# Coding Guidelines 

Here are some helpful pointers to abide by when coding for Team Hack.

## Our Code Is Open Source

Whatever we code is for the benefit of the open source community.  We generally follow the GNU LICENSE v3 Standard, so please be sure to familiarize yourself with it first and foremost.  You may use the code for your own projects, however you may not redistribute, plagiarize our projects as your own commercial projects for sale (in basic terms -- again read the full LICENSE for each project).  

## Be Ethical.  Do Not Do Harm To Others.

Please think before you code.  Do not code or partake in coding that would bring harm to other individuals.  Though our name is "Team Hack", we think of "hacking" in the ethical way; meaning we want to create and modify projects for means of betterment.  We do not mean "hacking" in the term of harming someone else's life, assets, computers, etc.

## Abide By Code of Conduct

Full code of conduct available at [JavaScriptLA/Code-of-Conduct](https://javascriptla.net/code-of-conduct/).  In basic terms, we wish for this community to be **inclusive**, meaning anyone can code -- regardless of gender, race, sexual preference, religion, political stance.  You may not troll/harrass/instigate our team members; doing so will result in your removal from this group.  We want our team to be **safe** for all its members.  

If you feel unsafe, threatened, harrassed by any other teammate within our team, please contact the admins of Team Hack directly via admin@teamhack.org.  We do not tolerate abusive behavior of any kind and will be swift in our action to help those in need of support.
